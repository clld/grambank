<h2> Functionalities of the web browser-interface </h2>The web browser interface is built on the CLLD framework.  </h2>

There are two horizontal menu bars. The top one contains tabs for information about the dataset. The bottom one is a sub-menu to the tab "home" on the first menu.

<h2>  Visualizing feature values on a map </h2>
Click the tab "Features" in the top menu. Select a feature. Scroll down to the heading "map".

<h2>  Combining features  </h2>
Click the tab "Features" in the top menu. Select a feature. Scroll down to a section with the sentence _You may combine this variable with a different variable by selecting on in the list below and clicking "Submit"._

Once you click "Submit", you will be taken to a new webpage with a map and table illustrating the combination of the features you selected. The URL will contain the Feature ID numbers, for example [https://grambank.clld.org/combinations/GB020_GB023](https://grambank.clld.org/combinations/GB020_GB023). If you add further Feature ID numbers to this URL, they will also be included, for example [https://grambank.clld.org/combinations/GB020_GB023_GB058](https://grambank.clld.org/combinations/GB020_GB023_GB058). 

<h2>  Visualizing feature values on a language family tree </h2>
Go to the tab "Languages and dialects" in the top menu. Click on the language family in the column "Family". At the top of the page, there is a section where you can select a feature. Once you click "Submit", you will be taken to a page showing that feature for that language family in a map and if you scroll down also on a tree, see example [here](https://grambank.clld.org/familys/aust1307?feature=GB020#tree-container). The URL will specify the language family glottocode and Grambank feature ID, you can share this URL to send others to the page.

<h2>  Further functionalities, such as comparing languages, other kinds of plotting, combining datasets, etc </h2>
